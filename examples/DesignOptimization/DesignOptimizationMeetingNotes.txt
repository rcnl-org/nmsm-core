Things to Talk About Tomorrow

automatic scaling?? keep space for users to define bounds, accommodate scaling 

Kinematics define the state, joint velocity, joint acceleration
	tendon force is in state?
Controls are synergy activations or torques
Initial Time, always constant?
Final Time, ask for range? vs ask for final time upper/lower
Guess is just data inputs?
	static parameters added to guess
Initial guess of parameters is baked into parameter definition? Range needed

Do we only do single phase?

Bounds:
	initial state bounds
		can initial state change?
		by how much?
	final state bounds
		can final state change?
		by how much?
	state bounds
		obviously states can change
		how to control how much state changes
		is state only kinematics?
		can use add time-variable 
	can you explain path constraints again?
	some quantity that varies with time, keeps it on rails, define width
	satisfy pelvis residuals as a path constraint
	on controls, states, calculated quantities
	control bounds
		can change? yes
		should they always be bounded 0-1?
		how to describe bounds amount? by percent??
		multiple for jerk
		for torque controls
		for synergy activations
	please explain integrals and integral bounds
		can integrate anything, can use integration in cost function
		including 'total' knee adduction
		
	duration upper/lower
		boolean element
		how much? range
	define static parameters
		if it's a static parameter it changes
		upper and lower bounds
	
Endpoint:
	objective
		how to let user add more objectives??
	what are eventgroups and do we care?
	event groups are terminal constraints
	periodicity is terminal constraint

Continuous:
	How do we calculate the dynamics??
	what is a path and integrand
	
	do you have examples of endpoint cost terms vs continuous cost terms?
	metabolic cost
	step length difference
