Discussion Points:
  - how MTP results fit into NeuralControlPersonalization
  - how precal fits into NeuralControlPersonalization
    - do we need precal settings?
  - how bilateral symmetry fits into NeuralControlPersonalization
  - NCPSynergyGroupList should be a single space separated list?
  - how do GroupedMuscles (GroupedActivations, GroupedSynergyWeights) fit into NeuralControlPersonalization
  - how to generate initialValues
    - set all to 0.1
    - commands also 0.1
    try running static optimization to get initial values
numMuscles divided by 2 or 10
    
printed after mtp
mtp synx included emg data 
mtp activations after activation dynamics - for use in NCP as emgActivation
also change bilateral symmetry writing to file
port over MTP activation and synergy weight similarity cost

one coordinate list, find activation if it doesn't exist, if muscle in synergy group doesn't cross joint then just exclude it
don't precal a muscle that has an activation
SynergyGroupSet

this is the max allowable value

combine activations for cost term or keep separate from a weight section
