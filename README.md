# basic-matlab-project

This is a basic MATLAB project intented to be used as a basis for a new project. It includes basic features including separate test, src and example directory and a MatLab project to change to your project's name. It also includes a test script to collect and run all of the tests in the /tests directory. Automatic workflows for testing on self-hosted MacOS and Windows runners are included.

## Getting Started

This project should be personalized to *your* project specifications, the following steps can be taken to make this repository ready for your project:

* Click the **Use this Template** button at the top of the repository
* Add a name (use dashes (-) as spaces) and description for the project
* Make sure the repository is private (we aren't ready for the world just yet)
* De-select **Include all branches**
* Change the **README.md** to reflect the new project

## Workflows (Automated Tests)

Two workflows are included in the .github directory. At this point, there are two workflows that use self-hosted runners, one tests the MatLab tests on a Windows runner and the other on a MacOS runner.

## Other Notes

* MatLab project names can't be changed. If you need the project name to change, delete the project file and resources folders and make a new project with the folder as the base.
